Complex regions have comparative advantage in many complex activities.\nEconomic complexity, when measured by product exports by country, is a strong predictor and driver of future economic growth, and reveals the trajectory of future growth. Countries with a higher level of complexity than their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would predict are more likely to grow faster in the future “Why Is Economic Complexity Important?” (2014).\nTypically, economic complexity is calculated at the national level - and a wealth of international data is available at the Atlas of Economic Complexity.\n\n\n\n\nAustralia’s economic complexity index has declined from a ranking of 55th in 1995 to 93rd in 2021. The high level of income relative to the low level of economic complexity means Australia is likely to grow more slowly in the future.\nComplexity is not distributed evenly across Australia, and each State and Territory has its own areas of specialisation.\nA policy response to Australia’s declining complexity should consider the complexity of Australian States.\n\nBuilding a model of economic complexity for Australian States requires state based commodity and services export data.

Note that some products are subject to Broad Commodity Details restrictions whose export value are not assigned to any State or Territory.
